    <string name="weed_phase">HOW TO CONTINUE YOUR PROGRESS Circumstances that may provoke relapses were pointed out in the above three phases.\n These circumstances will remain treacherous and probably provoke situations where you feel it as your human right to have a relapse, so don\'t lose your intellectual control.\n  Try to change your lifestyle. You have to prepare yourself! How are you going to tell your friends why you have quit smoking cannabis?\n  Try to develop daily and weekly plans, create new routines. Create a plan of actions for stressful situations. Try to establish new relationships. Try to be conscious of the qualitative value in your relationships. Try to establish realistic goals, to make your life manageable. Try to avoid situations and places that will lead to a relapse. If and when you get cravings, try to find the origin. You don\'t have to prove that you can abstain by consciously seeking old places of abuse. Once in a while it is important to focus on what made you decide to quit.
        Try to establish contact with someone who understands the process of change.</string>

Your cravings taper off but anxiety will start to rise.\n\n week: You made it a week. Pat yourself on the back, you\'ve made it through the worst. Keep avoiding those triggers.\n\n2 to 4 weeks: You still won‚Äôt have much energy, but the brain fog will be clearing up and your appetite will settle down. Your cough, depression, and anxiety will also improve. \n5 weeks on: The challenge now is keeping a strong mental game.</string>
