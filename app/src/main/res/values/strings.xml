    <string name="weed_phase">HOW TO CONTINUE YOUR PROGRESS Circumstances that may provoke relapses were pointed out in the above three phases.\n These circumstances will remain treacherous and probably provoke situations where you feel it as your human right to have a relapse, so don\'t lose your intellectual control.\n  Try to change your lifestyle. You have to prepare yourself! How are you going to tell your friends why you have quit smoking cannabis?\n  Try to develop daily and weekly plans, create new routines. Create a plan of actions for stressful situations. Try to establish new relationships. Try to be conscious of the qualitative value in your relationships. Try to establish realistic goals, to make your life manageable. Try to avoid situations and places that will lead to a relapse. If and when you get cravings, try to find the origin. You don\'t have to prove that you can abstain by consciously seeking old places of abuse. Once in a while it is important to focus on what made you decide to quit.
        Try to establish contact with someone who understands the process of change.</string>

    <string name="tips">Phase 1: Medical Focus\nDon\'t make the decision never to smoke again.\nMake the decision to abstain today. Tomorrow, you then make the decision to abstain that day, and so on.\nRelapses during this phase is mainly a reaction to avoiding the above listed withdrawal symptoms. Don\'t forget, these symptoms are only temporary. Notice even the slightest change of your perception of your immediate social environment. Consider the ways in which you change. Compare your way of functioning, now and under the influence of cannabis. Ask your friends or relatives if they have noticed any changes</string>
    <string name="tips2">\nPhase 2: Psychological Focus
You will still have difficulties dealing with the problems in your daily life. It will however change for the better. You will be emotionally unbalanced. Think of the things that make you feel good, and what makes you feel bad. Consider how you handle problems in your daily life. You have to identify different strategies for avoiding difficult situations. Use your new found ability of analyzing and reflection. Relapses in this phase are often caused by an inability to verbalize emerging feelings. Therefore it\'s important to continue to notice, compare and consider. Ask your friends or relatives if they have noticed any changes\n\n
        Phase 3: Social Focus\n
Compare your old cannabis-related notions about a "normal" life, with how you look at it now.\nYour old way of dealing with problems must be analyzed and eventually substituted with others more suitable. You have to focus on and question your goals. Where am I and where will I go? Try not to forget that you are in the beginning of a new phase in life, which has no end. It is a continuation of the psychological maturation which was slowed down by the effects of cannabis. Now is the time to try to remember why cannabis became an attractive drug. It is common that the chronic user has a transitional period of emptiness and a feeling of loss. .

    <string name="tip1">Think positive: \n  You might have tried to quit smoking before and not managed it, but don\'t let that put you off.   Look back at the things your experience has taught you and think about how you\'re really going to do it this time.</string>
    <string name="tip2">Make a plan to quit: \n  smoking Make a promise, set a date and stick to it. Sticking to the \"not a drag\" rule can really help.  Whenever you find yourself in difficulty, say to yourself, \"I won\'t even have a single drag\", and stick with this until the cravings pass.  Think ahead to times where it might be difficult, and plan your actions and escape routes in advance.</string>
    <string name="tip3">Make non-smoking friends: \n When you\'re at a party, stick with the non-smokers.  \"When you look at the smokers, don\'t envy them, Think of what they\'re doing as a bit strange ‚Äì lighting a small white tube and breathing in smoke.\"</string>
    <string name="tip4">Make a list of reasons to quit:\n  Keep reminding yourself why you made the decision to give up. Make a list of the reasons and read it when you need support.</string>
    <string name="tip5">Change your drink:\n  Fizzy drinks, alcohol, cola, tea and coffee all make cigarettes taste better.  So when you\'re out, drink more water and juice. Some people find simply changing their drink (for example, switching from wine to a vodka and tomato juice) affects their need to reach for a cigarette.</string>
